# Go-Racer

A simple CLI typing test tool written in Go. 

## Why I made this

I built Go-Racer to practice my typing accuracy and speed, specifically focusing on the things I interact with every day: programming and learning Spanish. 

Because it's extensible through plugins, I added features that let you type real code from GitHub and titles from Spanish news sites (like `go-racer -plugin spanish-news`). This makes typing practice much more relevant to my daily goals!
